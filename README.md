# LeNet5
Implement of Lenet5  in c++ for iOS. 

Relu6 for all layers is great!

The purpose of this project is to help iOS developer to learn and understand machine learning theory and algorithm.

And the training process is visible.

The algorithm is According the famous paper "Gradient descent learning applied to document recognition".

# About bias

i used to think bias of neural network is not important, there are already thousand of weights, is it necessary?

so i did not implement Lenet with trainable bias, just let the entire network has a fixed bias value 0.5. 
So the result of leaning is very bad, there no different between feature map, and at last layers there are no change according the input data. I was so confused about my code, after many times code review, paper review, and code rewrite, the network can learn well with 2 cases. 

It not good yet, with a flash in my brain, i realised, it needs bias to make the feature maps became different, so I rewrite the code related with bias, every feature map has a independent trainable bias, every thing became normal, the speed of learning is increased, the result is great, until now I understand the important of bias and how does it works.
